\section{Executables}
The program contains 4 different executables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{8BallPool}: the main executable that given a video file, it processes it and creates the output video.
	\item \texttt{TestAllClip}: the executable that was used to test the detection and segmentation in all the first and last clip of all videos.
	\item \texttt{ShowSegmentationColored}: the executable that was used to show the ground truth of the segmentation of a particular frame and it was also used
			as test for the code that computes the metrics because it computes the performance of the ground truth it self.
	\item \texttt{ComputePerfomance}: This executable was used to compute the performance across the dataset so the mAP and the mIoU.
	\item \texttt{InteractiveTracking}: % TODO: add description
\end{itemize}
