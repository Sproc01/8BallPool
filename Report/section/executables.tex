\section{Executables}
The program contains 4 different executables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{8BallPool}: the main executable that, given a video file, it processes it and creates the output video with the superimposed minimap.
	\item \texttt{TestAllClip}: it is the executable used to test the detection and segmentation in the first and last frame of all videos through AP and IoU by comparing them with the ground truth.
	\item \texttt{ShowSegmentationColored}: is an helper which has been used to show the ground truth of the segmentation of a particular frame using human-readable colors and it was also used as a test for the code that computes the metrics because it computes the performance of the ground truth on itself.
	\item \texttt{ComputePerformance}: is used to compute the performance across the dataset so the mAP and the mIoU.
\end{itemize}
