\section{Metrics}
The \texttt{computePerformance} executable handles both mAP and mIoU calculations.

\noindent\textbf{\emph{mAP (mean Average Precision)}}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Predictions are performed for all first and last frames in a video.
	\item Since we lack alternative \textit{confidence scores}, we opted to calculate mAP using IoU as the measure of confidence, because it is a good indicator of how good the detection is.
	\item For each object class (e.g., ball type), the Average Precision (AP) is calculated.
	\item Then the final mAP is obtained by averaging the AP values across all classes.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{\emph{mIoU (mean Intersection over Union)}}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item IoU is calculated for the first and the last frame for each video.
	\item The average IoU is then computed for each object class across all 20 images (10 videos each one with 2 frame) in the dataset.
	\item Finally, the mIoU is obtained by averaging the IoU values obtained in the last step.
\end{enumerate}

The 8BallPool executable displays the performance metrics (AP and IoU) achieved by the method for the specific input video.
