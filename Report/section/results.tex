\section{Results}

Table detection exhibits very high accuracy, in particular for each initial frame of each video four corner points are consistently identified across the dataset, the assumption that we made is that the camera does not move during a single clip so once the table is detected in the first frame we can use that information for all the frames of the same video.
In contrast, ball detection is influenced by k-means clustering. To achieve consistent and satisfactory results, a fixed random seed is incorporated into the code. This method results in an average mAP of 0.51 for the dataset.
