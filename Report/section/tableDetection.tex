\subsection{Table detection}

A mask-based approach was implemented for table detection, exploiting the consistent central positioning of the table within the dataset.  The mask was generated by identifying the most common color in the image's central columns.  Building upon this initial step, Michele exploits the Canny edge detector and OpenCV's HuoghLinesP function. Then the function analyzes intersections and merges nearby points, ensuring the consistent identification of four corner points corresponding to the table's corners in the processed dataset.
