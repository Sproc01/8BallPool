\subsection{Table detection}

A mask-based approach was implemented for table detection, exploiting the fact that in billiard games' footage, the table should be always located in the middle of the frame; this assumption is confirmed by all the videos in the dataset.
The mask was generated by identifying the most common color in the image's central columns; the color is represented by a range in the Hue component (with respect to HSV color space).
Building upon this initial step, Michele exploits the Canny edge detector and OpenCV's HoughLinesP function.
Then the function analyzes the found intersections and merges nearby points, ensuring the consistent identification of 4 corner points corresponding to the table's corners in the processed dataset.
