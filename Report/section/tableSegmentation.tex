\subsection{Table segmentation}

In order to isolate the table with high precision, Michele employed a combination on two different binary masks through a voting system.
The involved masks are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Color-based mask] Created by identifying pixels corresponding to the table's color range. This mask is very robust on shadows and reflections since it defined through the Hue component of the HSV color space, which is invariant to brightness.
	\item[k-means clustering mask] Generated by applying the k-means algorithm on the image to separate the table from the background. Useful when the table color range is too broad to be captured by the color-based mask.
\end{description}
These two masks are combined through a voting system, which classifies as table pixels classified as such by at least one of the two masks gaining the best of both approaches.
Finally the isolated area is limited to the pixels inside the polygon defined by the previously detected corners.
