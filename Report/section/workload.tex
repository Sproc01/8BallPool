\section{How the work has been split}
The three group members collaborated by dividing the work. Each member was responsible for producing specific files, all of which were annotated with their respective author.

\subsection{Split of the work}
The source code reflects a division of labor across three key areas:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Detection and segmentation of balls and the playing table: this area, along with the main program functionality, was handled by Michele.
	\item Metrics calculation and tracking: responsibility for this area fell to Alberto.
	\item Transformation code and mini-map management: this area was overseen by Michela.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Working hour per member}
The approximate number of working hours for each member of the group are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Michele:] 50 hours
	\item[Michela:] 50 hours
	\item[Alberto:] 50 hours
\end{description}
